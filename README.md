# Personal Website

## :page_with_curl: About
I created this portfolio website to showcase some of my software projects.  
This was a project I created while learning web development with Codecademy.  
As this was my first website that I designed and coded from scratch, I learned a tremendous amount and it was enjoyable to figure out how everything works.
